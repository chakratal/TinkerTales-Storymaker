{
  "Adventure": "Write in a fast-paced, daring voice, like Gordon Korman mixed with Indiana Jones for kids...",
  "Bedtime": "Use a soft, soothing voice like Margaret Wise Brown meets Kate DiCamillo at her gentlest...",
  "Comedy": "Write in the voice of a chaotic and funny narrator, like Roald Dahl mixed with Dav Pilkey...",
  "Fairy Tale": "Write in a whimsical, old-timey voice, like Julia Donaldson meets a friendly storyteller from long ago...",
  "Fantasy": "Write in a strange, curious voice, like early J.K. Rowling meets Lewis Carroll...",
  "Mystery": "Write like Lemony Snicket with a fast pace and dry humor. There must be a real mystery (not a prank) with odd clues and strange suspects. End with a clever or ridiculous twist that actually solves the case.",
  "Outer Space": "Write with giddy excitement, like a space-obsessed kid telling you about their alien best friend...",
  "Science Fiction": "Write like a madcap inventor crossed with a sarcastic robot...",
  "Spooky": "Write in a darkly playful voice, like Edward Gorey. The narrator should be dramatic, grim, slightly unhelpful, and offer absurd twists. End with a weird, ironic twist or unresolved mystery. Keep it spooky-but-silly, not scary."

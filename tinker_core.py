    "Bedtime": """Use a soft, soothing voice like Margaret Wise Brown meets Kate DiCamillo at her gentlest...""",
    "Comedy": """Write in the voice of a chaotic and funny narrator, like Roald Dahl mixed with Dav Pilkey...""",
    "Fairy Tale": """Write in a whimsical, old-timey voice, like Julia Donaldson meets a friendly storyteller from long ago...""",
    "Fantasy": """Write in a strange, curious voice, like early J.K. Rowling meets Lewis Carroll...""",
    "Mystery": """
    Use a clever, playful narrator voice‚Äîsomething between Lemony Snicket and Gordon Korman.

    Start with a cozy, slightly mysterious setting (e.g., ‚ÄúIn a town where the clouds gossiped‚Ä¶‚Äù). Introduce Uma, a dramatic and observant kid detective, in the middle of a seemingly minor crisis (a missing object, a weird noise, a suspicious trail). Use pronouns, inner thoughts, and varied sentence structures to avoid repeating her name too often.

    Build the mystery with misdirection, playful twists, and side characters who have strong personalities and quirks. Let them feel chaotic, suspicious, or downright weird. They should not behave politely or predictably. Give at least one suspect a truly strange or funny trait (e.g., hoards raisins, talks in rhymes, insists a bird told them who did it). Seed those traits early so their later involvement feels earned‚Äînot random.

    Add at least one unexpected turn‚Äîlike a clue that leads nowhere, a malfunctioning invention, or a red herring that throws Uma off track. Use running jokes, surprising reactions, or absurd logic to keep things playful.

    Avoid contradicting earlier clues. If someone finds the missing item, make sure their actions make sense. Don‚Äôt have a character confess to eating something that‚Äôs later found uneaten. Keep the story‚Äôs logic consistent and the resolution satisfying.

    The twist should not be a quiet confession. Make it funny, dramatic, or ridiculous. Maybe Max was hiding crumbs in his sock. Maybe the cookie was booby-trapped. Maybe there was a secret second cookie.

    End with a satisfying twist, callback, or joke. Let the narrator share an opinion or aside with the reader‚Äîsomething snarky, dramatic, or unexpectedly wise.

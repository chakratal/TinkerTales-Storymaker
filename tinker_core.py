    "Spooky": "Make it spooky-but-fun with mild suspense and strange but safe surprises. Use eerie settings, playful dread, and friendly monsters. Channel R.L. Stine for older kids and Scooby-Doo or silly ghost stories for younger ones.",
    "Fairy Tale": "Use whimsical language, magical settings, and talking creatures. Include a gentle moral, silly spells, and classic storybook structure. Think Julia Donaldson, Robert Munsch, or Gail Carson Levine.",
    "Fantasy": "Create imaginative worlds with odd magical rules and quirky characters. Balance wonder and humor, and include enchanted objects or unusual quests. Think C.S. Lewis, early J.K. Rowling, or Shannon Messenger.",
    "Mystery": "Make it puzzling and quirky with clever clues, red herrings, and weird logic. Include secret passages, strange suspects, and a satisfying twist. Think Lemony Snicket, The Mysterious Benedict Society, or a comedic Sherlock Holmes.",
    "Science Fiction": "Make it inventive, clever, and slightly absurd. Use futuristic gadgets, malfunctioning tech, and offbeat science logic. Think Phineas and Ferb meets Cory Doctorow or a junior version of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",
    "Outer Space": "Make it vibrant, silly, and full of space weirdness â€” talking aliens, gravity jokes, space pets. Keep the tone upbeat, adventurous, and zany, like a middle-grade Guardians of the Galaxy meets Sandra Boynton in zero gravity.",
    "Adventure": "Use fast pacing, physical action, and imaginative obstacles. Include treasure maps, wild villains, and big payoffs. Think Magic Tree House, Percy Jackson, or Gordon Korman â€” lighthearted and bold.",
    "Bedtime": "Use gentle rhythm, soft sensory language, and calming repetition. Keep the tone poetic, dreamy, and peaceful. Think Margaret Wise Brown, Owl Moon, or Kate DiCamillo's quietest moments â€” perfect for winding down."

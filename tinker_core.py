    "Fantasy": """Write in a strange, curious voice, like early J.K. Rowling meets Lewis Carroll...""",
    "Mystery": """
    Use a sly, clever narrator voice like Lemony Snicket with a magnifying glass and a cookie crumb trail.

    Start the story with a cozy, slightly mysterious setting (e.g., ‚ÄúIn a town where it always smelled faintly of pancakes,‚Äù ‚ÄúOn a foggy morning when the gnomes were up to something,‚Äù etc.).

    Then introduce Uma, a clever and slightly dramatic kid detective, in the middle of a very serious personal problem (like a missing slipper, a vanishing sandwich, or a glitter trail that should not exist). The mystery should be fun, weird, and surprising‚Äîbut still grounded.

    The tone should be playful, fast-paced, and filled with little twists, red herrings, and running jokes (e.g., suspicious cats, peanut butter trees, morally shady frogs).

    Let the mystery end in a clever solution, not just a reveal. Uma should feel like the hero because she *figured it out*.

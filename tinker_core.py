    "Adventure": """Write in a fast-paced, daring voice, like Gordon Korman mixed with Indiana Jones for kids...""",

    "Comedy": """Write in the voice of a chaotic and funny narrator, like Roald Dahl mixed with Dav Pilkey...""",
    "Fairy Tale": """Write in a whimsical, old-timey voice, like Julia Donaldson meets a friendly storyteller from long ago...""",
    "Fantasy": """Write in a strange, curious voice, like early J.K. Rowling meets Lewis Carroll...""",
    "Mystery": """
    Write in a playful, clever voice like Lemony Snicket or Gordon Korman. Use dry humor, dramatic exaggeration, and occasional asides to the reader.

    The story must revolve around a real mystery (not a prank), with strange suspects and absurd clues that seem useless at first but make sense later.

    Avoid repeating the main character's name too much. Use pronouns, reactions, and inner thoughts to vary the sentence structure and keep things engaging.

    Side characters should be odd, dramatic, or over-the-top. Think: someone who talks only in rhyme, a librarian who refuses to whisper, or a pigeon with a vendetta. Let them feel chaotic, suspicious, or weird â€” never generic.

    Make sure the twist isn't a quiet confession. Aim for something funny, dramatic, or ridiculous. It should feel surprising but consistent with the clues dropped earlier.

    The narrator should have a voice â€” let them make snarky comments, express disbelief, or joke with the reader. The story should feel like a mash-up of Snicket's mystery absurdism and Korman's fast, funny pacing.

    Finish with a satisfying or hilarious resolution and a final wink to the reader.

    The story should include:

    - A clear beginning, middle, and end
    - At least one surprising twist or unexpected character
    - Around 500-550 words
